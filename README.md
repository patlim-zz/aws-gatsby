Hey there!

This is a project created to learn more about AWS continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Using S3 buckets, codebuild and codepipeline I am hosting a live static site with CI/CD.

Please check out my live Gatsby site here [link](http://aws-gatsby.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com)
Not much to see on the website at the moment, but behind the scenes all my changes, with AWS, will be pushed directly to this endpoint!
