Hey there!

I created this project to explore and learn AWS continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Using S3 buckets, codebuild and codepipeline I am hosting a live site with CI/CD functionality.

Please check out my live Gatsby site here [link](http://aws-gatsby.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com)
Not much to see on the website at the moment, but behind the scenes all my changes, with AWS, will be pushed directly to this endpoint!
